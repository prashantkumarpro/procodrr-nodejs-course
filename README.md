## Complete Backend With Node.js â€“ Notes by Hameed Khan and I'm getting the benifites. I don't need to make notes. A big thanks to Hameed Khan

These notes are a mix of my personal understanding and content generated using ChatGPT and DeepSeek.

This repo was created by **Hameed Khan** while taking the ongoing paid course **Complete Backend With Node.js 2024** by **Anurag Singh**, available on [**procodrr.com**](https://procodrr.com/).

The notes were written while watching the course videos. Since English is not my first language, there might be some typos or minor inaccuracies. Everything here is based on my own understanding of the topics covered.
